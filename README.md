This simple gui tool used for generating passwords "on the fly".

Do you really need it? ok.

Clone repo and run it with "racket" interpreter or compile it to binary with **raco** compiler.

## If you think that this tool is good idea

Please write me and I make it better(usable at least).

Feel free to do anything that you want with it
